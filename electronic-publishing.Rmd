# Introduction

\myTitleMainTitle

This report records the determinations made by microscopic examination of Lepidoptera specimens made by VC55 recorders. Specimens were not retained, as each determination is illustrated by micro-photographs of specimens and temporary slides. The high quality micro-photographs were produced by stacked focus photography and are much easier to work with than traditional permanent slides. In most cases, the artificial depth of field provides a better view of dissected parts than can be seen through a microscope. Using micro-photographs has also allowed on-line collaboration using the version management tool GitHub (https://github.com) to manage this and other reports. 

The primary sources for identifying Lepidoptera by dissection used in this work are @Hall2021 and @Schon2021. The determination was also checked against the appearance of the imago using @Kimber2021 amongst other sources.


# Species Summary

The species recorded are presented in Table \@ref(tab:TableSpeciesList) which has been directly generated from the records.

```{r TableSpeciesList, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(plyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(gridExtra)

absolute.path <- rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file()

path.to.my.data <- fs::path( absolute.path
                               ,"data-ss","data-ss", ext = "rds")

my.data.ss <- readRDS(path.to.my.data)

columns.to.keep <- c("order","family","taxon","gender")

my.species.present <- my.data.ss[,columns.to.keep]

my.species.present$gender <- my.species.present$gender %>% unlist()

#my.species.present$num <- 1
#my.species.present.gender <- pivot_wider(data = my.species.present, names_from =  gender)

my.species.summary <-   my.species.present %>% group_by(family, taxon, gender) %>% 
  tally(name = "Count") %>% arrange(family,taxon)

# Drop rows where family = Family
rows.to.keep <- !grepl("Family",my.species.summary$family )
my.species.summary.clean <- my.species.summary[rows.to.keep,]

knitr::kable(my.species.summary.clean, caption = 'Species recorded by family and gender.',booktabs = TRUE, longtable = TRUE) %>%   kable_styling(latex_options = "striped") %>%   kable_styling(latex_options = "repeat_header")

rows.to.keep <- !grepl("Unknown",my.species.summary$family )
my.species.summary.ID <- my.species.summary[rows.to.keep,]

# Look for the 03 files to include

my.03.files <- list.files(
  absolute.path,
  pattern = "^03.*.Rmd$", # Make a suitable filter. Use the dot for a wildcard. note the use of the $ to match the files extension.
  full.names = TRUE,
  recursive = FALSE) 


```

A total of `r sum(my.species.summary.ID$Count)` specimens were examined of which `r sum(my.species.summary.clean$Count)` were identified.


```{r, child= c('_working_code_blocks.Rmd','07-map.Rmd')}

```

```{r, child= c(my.03.files )}
