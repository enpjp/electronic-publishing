@article{Hardwick1950,
abstract = {One of the most essential procedures in the identification of many Lepidop-tera is an examination of the genitalia, and for a most critical examination of these organs slide mounts must he prepared. Tn many cases, the preparation of slides is one of the most neglected arts in lepidopterology. This is to be deplored, for a well-prepared slide is not only hantnclsome but also much more valuable taxonomically than a messily prepared one. For large and medium-sized specimens, I have found the following technique very gratifying in producing slides of uniformly high quality. Certain phases of the technique are not particularly well adapted for working with smaller moths. Labelling The specimen whose genitalia are to be studied is first provided with a number by which cross-reference may be made between slide mount and specimen. Slide number labels are prepared in duplicate. One of these is affixed to the pin holding the specimen, and the other accompanies the genitalia through the various reagents. For the latter purpose the slide number should be written on white card with an HB pencil. Corrosion The abdomens of specimens to be studied are immersed in a ten per cent solution of potassium hydroxide overnight. A few hours more or less in the caustic does little to alter its action. Generally, the use of cold caustic over a more or less prolonged period gives much more uniform results than relatively short immersion in hot or boiling caustic. Dissection and Dehydration After removal from the caustic the abdomen is placed in a dissection dish containing 30 per cent alcohol, in which the genitalia are removed and prepared for subsequent treatment. Male Genitalia.-To remove male genitalia from the abdomen, the closed ends of a pair of curved forceps are placed on the lateral surface of the abdomen at the anterior end. This forces the contents toward the rear. A second pair of forceps.is then placed on the abdomen immediately posterior to the first pair. This process is continued backward along the length of the abdomen. The},

@article{Miller2000,
abstract = {The strildngly similar Old World olethreutines Notocelia rosaecolana (Doubleday) and N trimaclliana (Haworth) have long been differentiated with seven structural and wing-pattern characters, Because these characters are quantitative and difficult to apply, it is unclear whetber one or hoth taxa were aCCidentally introduced into North America. We evaluate the seven characters by examining each one (y) relative to forewing lengtb (x), a surrogate for body size. in a basic sample of60 specimens of both taxa from two continents, using the allometric equation y = a(xb), All seven characters proved to be body-size dependent and to lack discontinuities necessary for discrete states, thus rendering them diagnostically inadequate, Fortunately, a new qualitative diagnostic character emerged from this study: presence or absence of melanic sex scales near the base of the male hindwing hair pencil. These scales were absent in the putative type of N. trimaculana but present in those of N. rosaecolana, thus c1mifjing species identities and shOwing that N rosaeeo/ana is the only member of the pair thus far present in North America,},
